To compile, run from the MarketPlace found in the src folder.
From there, feel free to register a new user, or users.
You can register as either a buyer OR a seller.  However, there is only 
one admin and you cannot sign in as an admin.  
We will have test users in .csv files so you don't have to create a bunch
of test users yourselves.  

Do not move the location of anything, it is vital that the bin folder stays as is.  

Information is saved to the .csv files.  Feel free to view but do not mess with it.  

For testing, we have included a TestSystem.txt file of us using all of the possible functions.
We have included comments on the text file to help you read through what is going on.
